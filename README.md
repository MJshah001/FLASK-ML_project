# Flight Price Prediction using AWS Sagemaker, Flask API & Streamlit

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project includes various features such as airline, source, destination, departure time, and more. The model was trained using XGBoost on AWS SageMaker and deployed as a REST API using Flask, as well as a web application using Streamlit.

`curl` is a command-line tool used for making HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use `curl` to send a request to the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://flask-ml-project-flight-price-prediction.onrender.com/api/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
